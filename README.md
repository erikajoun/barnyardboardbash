Barnyard Board Bash is a farm themed board game intended for young children. The game contains a collection of mini games using augmented reality which compliments the main, CandyLand style game board. We created this project in 24 hours for HackXX 2018.

## Overview
Our group had never used augmented reality before and we decided we wanted to learn it. We came up with the idea of a Mario Party style board game for children because simple mini games allowed us to explore many different elements of augmented reality and prevented us from being stuck on a single idea for too long (important because this hackathon was exceptionally short).

The game consists of a deck of mini game cards and a selection of character cards. Using our Unity app which is compatible with Android, IOS, Windows, and macOS, you can scan the character cards to view 3D models of the animal you are playing as. Players take turns drawing cards from the mini game deck and use their app to play the corresponding mini game. If they are successful a completing the game, the player can advance to the next space that matches the color of their card. The first player to reach the finish wins.

Our group used Unity and Vuforia to create our mini games. We designed the game and character cards using Adobe Illustrator and then sent the pictures to a Vuforia database. We then used 3D models off the Unity Asset Store and came up with different ways to control them including joystick and tap controls. Although our group had previous experience with Unity, this was our first time ever working with Unity 3D. An additional challenge we faced was that many of our computers were too weak to run 3D models and so we spent the majority of the hackathon taking turns coding on a single laptop.

## Mini Games 
Below are the various mini games that we created for our project.

### Chick Collect
This game is played by controlling a chicken using the joystick. The goal is to collect all of the eggs on the screen before time runs out.

### Carrot Harvest
The goal of this game is to tap on all of the carrots before time runs out. Note: A touch screen is required.

### Bull Stampede
The objective of this game is to survive the incoming stampede of bulls before the timer runs out.

### Duck Hunt
<i>Only partially completed; unable to finish before 24 hour deadline.</i>
This game is similar to the popular arcade game Snake. The goal is to collect all of the ducklings while also avoiding stepping on the ones you've already collected.

### Crop Counter
This game will ask that you count how many of each crop are on the screen. It will then ask you a question based on their quantities.

### Moo Moo Maze
The objective of this game is to naviate the maze and reach the hamburger at the end.

### IDEA: Sheep Herder
<i>Unable to be completed before the 24 hour deadline.</i>
Our idea for this game was to use tilt controls to move sheep into a pen.

### IDEA: Pig Pleaser
<i>Unable to be completed before the 24 hour deadline.</i>
This game was going to be similar to the game Simon. A pig was going to ask you to repeat the order that he requests food in.
